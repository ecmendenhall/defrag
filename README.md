## About Defragment.art

Fractionalizing NFTs is cool, but wouldn't you rather have a fun JPEG in your wallet instead of 30,000 ERC20 tokens?

Defragment.art allows Fractional vault curators to create new derivative NFTs mintable by fraction holders.

For vault curators:

    To create a new Defrag token contract, select "Create Defrag" above.
    Provide a Fractional Vault address and the minimum number of fractions required to mint a derivative NFT.
    Provide a name and symbol for the derivative token.
    Click "Defrag" to deploy the derivative NFT contract.

For fraction holders:

    To mint a Defrag token from your fractions, select "Mint" above, and choose a Defrag token.
    Provide the number of fractions you'd like to use to mint the token.
    Your fractions will be bundled inside your Defrag token, giving it an underlying value.
    You can redeem it at any time to get back the bundled fractions.
    To redeem your Defrag token for the underlying fractions, select "Redeem" above.
